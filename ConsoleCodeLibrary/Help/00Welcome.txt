'Welcome!'
:CONTENT:

Welcome to the Console Code Library or someother whatever I've named it now.

This is the basic framework of a project.

I will build out from here to customize this as an assistant for my job.

Controls are:
Tab					-	Switches between categories	
Right/Left Arrow	-	Switches focus from the content
						pane to the content pane			
						(if there is more content to view,
						 as indicated by a "...More"
 						 in the bottom right corner)
Up/Down Arrow		-	Scrolls through individual snippets
Page Up/Down		-	When focus is on list, and list is longer
						than the screen allows it will scroll
						through pages in the list. When focus
						is on content with multiple pages,
						will scroll through the pages.
:BREAK:
F1					-	Halp
F2					-	Adds copyable text to clipboard
F10					-	Exit
F12					-	Redraw the window. (If you resize the console
						window, the display will be scrambled. F12
						will redraw at current console size)
